Well…I have an art degree with a focus on painting and drawing.  So I love making art.\nOut of university, I was a retoucher for about 5 years where I honed my photoshop skills.  That being said,\nI’ve never really spent any significant time behind a camera.  Took a class in university once.  But that was it.\nPhotography has always appealled to me, until I saw the price of all the equipment.  Geeze. I’m far to clumsy to be walking around with $10k worth of equipment.</p>\n<p>Anywhoo. My wife loves being outdoors, and I thought photography would be a great opportunity to share\nmy love for technology and art with her love of pretty places.  So I created this blog so I can keep track\nof my learnings.  And hopefully this can help out someone else who is just starting out in photography.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
