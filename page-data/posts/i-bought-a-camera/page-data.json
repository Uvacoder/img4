This week I purchased the Canon EOS SL3 or 250D depending on where you live.  I had narrowed the choice down to the SL3, M50 and the T8i.  Which are all pretty much the same camera from what I gathered.  At least for the features I cared about.  Most of the articles and videos pointed me in the direction of these 3 cameras.  You can see a comparison chart <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/compare/Canon_M50_vs_Canon_Rebel_T8i_vs_Canon_Rebel_SL3/BHitems/1393460-REG_1546030-REG_1473086-REG\">here</a></p>\n<h2>Features I Considered</h2>\n<h3>Pixels</h3>\n<p>Should come to no surprise that megapixels came into play.  All 3 cameras that I looked at are exactly the same (24.1 megapixels).  During the investigation I found out a couple of interesting things. Mostly that camera companies lie to customers quite a bit.  Or rather they give specs in the best possible environment for the feature to succeed.  For example, with megapixels, they are dispersed between red, green, and blue on the censor. If you were to take a picture of something that is exactly neutral grey you’ll get the advertised megapixels. But if you shoot something that is completely red.  You are only getting a fraction of the full megapixels.  Specifically, the megapixels set aside for the color red.  So in real world situations you’ll never get the advertised pixels.</p>\n<h3>Full frame vs. Cropped</h3>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 960px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/bab57cef404320ac7059164a371a4534/6a068/fullframe.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/bab57cef404320ac7059164a371a4534/8ac56/fullframe.webp 240w,\n/static/bab57cef404320ac7059164a371a4534/d3be9/fullframe.webp 480w,\n/static/bab57cef404320ac7059164a371a4534/e46b2/fullframe.webp 960w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/bab57cef404320ac7059164a371a4534/09b79/fullframe.jpg 240w,\n/static/bab57cef404320ac7059164a371a4534/7cc5e/fullframe.jpg 480w,\n/static/bab57cef404320ac7059164a371a4534/6a068/fullframe.jpg 960w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/bab57cef404320ac7059164a371a4534/6a068/fullframe.jpg\"\n          alt=\"&#39;Full frame vs cropped&#39;\"\n          title=\"Photo from [the photography blogger](http://www.the-photography-blogger.com/full-frame-vs-crop-sensor-camera-all-you-need-to-know/)\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"><p>Photo from <a href=\"http://www.the-photography-blogger.com/full-frame-vs-crop-sensor-camera-all-you-need-to-know/\">the photography blogger</a></p></figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>This is just the size of the sensor.  The one thing that I noticed is pricing between full and cropped is significant. This was what helped me filter down my choices to these 3. Generally a full frame works better in low light situations, and for wider angle shots.  Cropped frames just changes the focal length of a given lens.  For example, all 3 cameras I looked at uses an APS-C sensor, which has a crop factor of 1.6.  Which means a lens that is 50mm on a full-frame would look like 80mm on the cropped. Everything would look zoomed in when comparing the 2.  There are adapters that fix this if you really care, but in my books it’s not a huge deal.  I’d just take a couple steps backward.</p>\n<h3>Mirrorless vs. DSLR</h3>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 600px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/22c335760501e3329c236860cf6ab523/b4294/mirrorless.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 57.08333333333333%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/22c335760501e3329c236860cf6ab523/8ac56/mirrorless.webp 240w,\n/static/22c335760501e3329c236860cf6ab523/d3be9/mirrorless.webp 480w,\n/static/22c335760501e3329c236860cf6ab523/e88ff/mirrorless.webp 600w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/22c335760501e3329c236860cf6ab523/09b79/mirrorless.jpg 240w,\n/static/22c335760501e3329c236860cf6ab523/7cc5e/mirrorless.jpg 480w,\n/static/22c335760501e3329c236860cf6ab523/b4294/mirrorless.jpg 600w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/22c335760501e3329c236860cf6ab523/b4294/mirrorless.jpg\"\n          alt=\"&#39;Mirrorless cameras&#39;\"\n          title=\"Photo from [thecaeramthing](http://thecamerathing.blogspot.com/2017/11/mirrorless-vs-dslr-cameras-whats.html)\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"><p>Photo from <a href=\"http://thecamerathing.blogspot.com/2017/11/mirrorless-vs-dslr-cameras-whats.html\">thecaeramthing</a></p></figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>This one was new to me.  I never heard of mirrorless before.  But the name pretty well explains the difference.  One has a mirror, the other doesn’t. With DSLRs, when you look through the viewfinder, it reflects off mirrors and goes through the lens.\nWith mirrorless, they replaced the mirrors with a screen which sees whatever the sensor sees. What is the benefit?  Smaller cameras. The downside is it eats up your battery life.  I’m cool with a bigger camera.  When I got my camera I was surprised\nat how small it was.  I almost think mirrorless would be too small for me.  (I’m a pretty tall guy)  The M50 is mirrorless. The other 2 are not. Between the M50 and the SL3, the specs are pretty well exactly the same except for this feature.  And I didn’t need to spend extra money to get it.</p>\n<h3>Battery life</h3>\n<p>From the reviews that I read, the SL3 had the best battery life between the 3.  The M50 being mirrorless is prone to having a poor battery life. The T8i seemed to be pretty good as well, but the SL3 was still better.  I suspect because it has a newer sensor so it’s a little more efficient.</p>\n<h3>Wifi / Bluetooth</h3>\n<p>I thought this was just cool.  Being able to take photos with your phone / computer.  More importantly, you can transfer your photos directly to your devices! No more having to deal with card readers.  That being said, I suspect card readers are substantially quicker than doing it over the network. So transferring huge amount of data could possibly be painful.  Plus you need to keep your camera on that entire time which is a waste of the batteries. Still cool.</p>\n<h2>So Far So Good</h2>\n<p>At this point, I’ve only had the camera for a couple days.  But it seems pretty good.  The one thing that surprised me was the menu system. It is very similar to point and click cameras.  Which was a little disheartening at first.  Then I realized, you can turn most of that off. Some of it was useful for me, I didn’t know what some of the abbreviations meant on the of camera.  Overall I’m still very happy with my purchase. I’m looking forward to learning more about how to use it.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/equipment/","/tags/photography/"],"slug":"/posts/i-bought-a-camera/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I Bought a Camera","tags":["Equipment","Photography"],"date":"2020-08-08T17:03:00.000Z","description":"Deciding between the Canon SL3, M50 and T8i"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/i-bought-a-camera/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
