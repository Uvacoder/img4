I need a camera.  At first glance there are toooo many options. So many different brands. Pricing ranging from a couple hundred to several thousands of dollars. What is so different that there is such a price gap?  And when shopping there are so many acronyms that I don’t understand.  What is important?  What should I care about as a beginner? So many questions.  A little daunting.  I’m finding the process very similar to building your own computer.  No choice but to jump right in.</p>\n<h2>Camera Brands</h2>\n<p>One thing that I noticed after doing a little research online.  Photographers all have their own preference of cameras.  Some swear by Nikon others by Canon, Sony, etc.  I think once you get into the nitty gritty, each company probably excels at some things more than others.  </p>\n<p>I’m looking at it like car companies.  Some are better at interiors and comfort, some are better at reliability and safety.  Everyone has their preference based on experience.  Really any company could have the best model of the year, and the next year not have the top model.  So that’s the approach I’m looking at this.</p>\n<p>Personally I’ve developed a preference in my retouching days.  This was back when digital cameras were just approaching the quality of film.  Things are probably drastically different now a days.  That being said, the photographer that I worked for decided to take the plunge into digital.  He had used a Nikon.  Looking at the photos it took, I really didn’t enjoy the colors.  Skin tones looked pasty to me.  Later he bought a Canon and I thought the colors looked a lot better. It could just be the maturity of the sensors.  As I said, this was definitely during a transition period for digital.  So from that perspective, I’m probably going to go with Canon just to narrow my field of vision on which to purchase.  Could be a big mistake…but I’m pretty sure all entry level cameras aren’t going to be that different.  It’s more when you get into the professional grade where it matters. (Famous last words)</p>\n<h2>Price Range</h2>\n<p>This is really going to depend on how much cash you have lying around.  For me I’m looking for something around the $1000 mark (Canadian dollars).  It’s easy to get tied up in all the features and their coolness factor.  I think choosing a price point before you even delve in will prevent you from jumping down the cool toys rabbit hole…which I enjoy too much.</p>\n<h2>What am I Going to Use it For?</h2>\n<p>To really decide which features in a camera are important to me.  It’s really important to know what I’m going to use it for.  I’m pretty sure landscape photography is completely different from someone shooting sporting events.  I’ll be using it for landscape photography…mostly.  Trying to take pictures of my 4 year old I guess could be considered a sporting event as well ;) I haven’t really looked into what features camera offer yet.  But my guess is durability, and weather resistance.  Possibly weight if I’m doing a lot of hiking to get to the shooting spot.  Stuff like that.</p>\n<h2>Narrowed it down</h2>\n<p>Now onto research.  I’ve filtered my search down to a $1000 Canon that is good for landscape photography.  Hopefully this won’t be too painful.  Fingers crossed.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/equipment/","/tags/photography/"],"slug":"/posts/which-camera-to-buy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Which Camera to Buy?","tags":["Equipment","Photography"],"date":"2020-08-03T17:03:00.000Z","description":"Figuring out which camera is a good starting point for beginners."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/which-camera-to-buy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
