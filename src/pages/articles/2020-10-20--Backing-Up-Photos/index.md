As I'm starting to take more photos, I'm starting to realize my workflow is painful.   Photos are all over the place, and aren't consistently placed anywhere.  I could have imported my work from 3 different computers/tablets.  Just a mess.  I finally figured out a workflow that works for me, and I thought I'd share.

## Importing

I need to be consistent here. In the past, I've uploaded them to either my work computer (laptop), my mac mini, or used wifi to get it onto the Ipad. One thing that I found I enjoyed is using Lightroom on my Ipad.  I can sit and watch TV and edit photos.  But for photoshop and that sort of thing, I'd want it on my laptop.  I've settled on importing it directly onto my Ipad through wifi.  I could probably get a card reader for my Ipad, but I haven't done that yet, so I'm stuck with slow imports if I want to use my Ipad.  I'm okay with it...It's a lifestyle decision.  If I'm feeling saucy and decide to import directly to my laptop, that works as well.  It is ultimately where I want the files to end up.

## Transfering to the Laptop

After I've modified things in Lightroom on the Ipad if I need to do retouching it needs to be on my laptop.  I tried photoshop on my Ipad...I just couldn't deal with it.  I'm currently on the budget Adobe plan which gives me 20GB of cloud storage.  Which is more than enough for me to transfer a single shoot to my computer.  But nowhere enough for me to keep all my photos in the cloud.  They offer a 2TB solution, but for the price, it's not worth it to me.  If it was unlimited space.  Absolutely.  Because of the limit of space, I'm going to use the Lightroom downloader.  Which essentially downloads the files from your Lightroom cloud files onto your computer.  Then I'll use Lightroom classic / photoshop if I want to do any further edits.  Ultimately I will remove it from the Lightroom cloud after it is on the laptop.  I should mention, Lightroom classic won't be synced to the cloud.  It only works on files on my computer.

## Backing Things Up.

I wanted to keep my files on an external hard drive, as well as in the cloud.  Also, I wanted access to my photos on my phone / Ipad at any given point.  Which is a problem.  Ultimately my retouched files will be on my laptop.  So I needed a cloud backup that allows me to access everything on any device.  I also needed something that has unlimited space, and is somewhat cheap.  I landed on Backblaze.  All the other cloud services I saw had a limit of 2TB.  Which I'm sure it would take me a very long time to get to.  But with Backblaze, I don't have to worry about that, and it's only $6/month.  I got an 8TB drive, and drop all my raw / processed files on there, and Backblaze backs it up for me.  They have an app that I have access to all my files that were backed up.

And that's it.  I want to do some automation around uploading to my blog here.  But besides that I'm happy with how things are working so far.
