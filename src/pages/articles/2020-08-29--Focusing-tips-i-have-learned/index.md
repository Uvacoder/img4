Focusing has been a struggle for me since ever since I've started.  Partially it's because I'm drawn to blurry backgrounds and more macro type shots.  Which means I've been working with my lens fully zoomed in, with a very shallow depth of field.  A recipe for focusing disaster.  Even still, I wanted to share some of the things that I've learnt online as they've been super helpful.



## Zoom in?  You Can Do THAT!?

One thing that I've been strugling with is being able to preview the shot that I just took and be able to tell if it's actually sharp.  With the sun reflecting off of the display it's just hard to tell.  This probably doesn't come as a surprise to any photographer that actually read their camera's manual, but you can zoom in on your subject in preview mode!  This was a game changer for me as I could figure out if I needed to try again or not.



## Move Yourself, Not the Focus Ring

This one is a tip I've seen that mostly macro photographers do.  They set everything up, then they just move the camera back and forth until they get the sweet spot.  With the wind blowing flowers around and such, it makes life easier.  This probably doesn't make sense to do if you have a tripod setup or if you're doing a different type of photography.  For the type of stuff I've been doing, it definitely makes sense.



## Shutter Speed Minimum

I've been doing a lot of my shots lately on aperture priority.  Like I said, I love that sweet sweet blurriness. mmmmm.  Based on lighting conditions this can drop my shutter speed down, as I'm usually locking in my ISO pretty low.  I learnt as a rule of thumb you should try to keep it above 1/60 if you're shooting hand held.  For telephoto lenses it's a little different as they're more susceptible to movement.  The rule I heard was, take your crop factor and multiply it by the focal length.  For example, I have an apc censor, which has a crop factor of 1.6.  So if I was shooting with a 100mm lens, I should keep my shutter speed faster than 1/160. Fancy!  I love these kind of rules.  Makes my life that much easier.



## Stack Them Focuses

This one is kind of interesting.  Focus stacking is taking several shots with different focus points, and merging them together in post process.  A handy tip for landscape photographers.  For example, if you take a picture with the foreground in focus, take another with the mid-ground in focus, then one with the background.  Stitch them together in photoshop, and you've got yourself a sharp focus from top to bottom.  This definitely needs to be done on a tripod.   This can also be done for macro photography where you'd focus on something up close, then something a little further away.  This will give you the ability to widen your depth of field in post processing.  This one is a little harder, but there are apps out there that will help stitch things together.  I forget what apps they are, but I'm sure google can help with that if you're interested.



## Keep It Crispy

So that's my tips.  I've noticed a difference in my shots since I've started using some of these.  Less mess ups.  Hope it helps a little.
