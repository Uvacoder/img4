A little about me.  I'm a staff software engineer by day.  I break stuff on the internet, then fix it again.
And I suck at photography.

So why a blog about photography?  Well...I have an art degree with a focus on painting and drawing.  So I love making art.
Out of university, I was a retoucher for about 5 years where I honed my photoshop skills.  That being said,
I've never really spent any significant time behind a camera.  Took a class in university once.  But that was it.
Photography has always appealled to me, until I saw the price of all the equipment.  Geeze. I'm far to clumsy to be walking around with $10k worth of equipment.

Anywhoo. My wife loves being outdoors, and I thought photography would be a great opportunity to share
my love for technology and art with her love of pretty places.  So I created this blog so I can keep track
of my learnings.  And hopefully this can help out someone else who is just starting out in photography.
